Old notes
=========

- more explicit error message when coupling is used (un?)initialised
  [and clean up of whole alphas code?]

- get intrinsic charm working with cached evolution (threshold
  operators should become additive rather than multiplicative)

- for version 2: replace evop%cross_mass_threshold with evop%apply_mass_threshold
