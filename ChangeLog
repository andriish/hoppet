2023-10-03 Tue  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> with Giulia and Paolo

	* src/pdf_general.f90:
	InitPDF_LHAPDF() used to expect the LHAsub to set -6:6; 
	now it expects -6:6 with plain QCD evolution, but
	the full size of the flavour dimension if the upper limit
	is anything other than ncompax=7 (e.g. for QED evolution 
	it should go up to ncompmaxLeptons=11).

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	switched this over the version prepared by Giulia and Paolo

	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.default_output:
	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.f90:

	reworked the QED initial condition that had been put in a few
	commits ago (no ChangeLog entry) so that it conserves momentum sum
	rule and updated the default output so that make check works...

2023-09-21 Thu  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> + Giulia

	* example_f90/tabulation_example.f90:
	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.f90:
	switched these over to use InitGridDefDefault

	* src/qed_objects.f90:
	added Delete for the QED splitting matrices

	* src/qed_evolution.f90:
	fixed serious memory leak in QEDQCDEvolvePDF where internal
	coupling_qcd_zero was not being deleted at the end of the function.

	* src/dglap_objects.f90:
	fixed minor memory leak, where Delete(MassThresholdMat) was leaving
	out one piece of the deletion

2023-09-16 Sat  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.f90:  *** ADDED ***
	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.default_output:  *** ADDED ***
	added this example to show how to use basic QED + QCD evolution
	to obtain a tabulated QED PDF and included default output

	* src/qed_coupling.f90:
	updated alpha(0) and lepton masses to 2022 PDG value_at_scale_0.

	Also updated interface to InitQEDCoupling so that the user can
	make their own choice for the effective light quark masses,
	which they can tune so that alpha(0) and alpha(mZ) are both
	reasonably sensible.

	* src/hoppet_v1.f90:
	included the QED modules

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90:
	fixed an issue where tab%tab_iflv_max was not being sets
	correctly, causing returned PDF to be unset beyond iflv=6

	* scripts/check:
	added a loop over tests to run and make sure failure causes exit 1

2023-09-13  Giulia Zanderighi  <zanderi@mpp.mpg.de>

	* src/qed_evolution.f90:
	* src/qed_objects.f90:
	* src/qed_splitting_functions.f90:
	incorporated NNLO QED Plq splitting function, as used in Lepton PDF project.

2023-03-12 Sun  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* .github/workflows/CI.yml:
	added an attempt at continuous integration using github actions

2023-03-12  Alexander Puck Neuwirth + small mods by Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> 

	* src/warnings_and_errors.f90:
	wae_error(...): replaced "stop" with "call exit(-1)", which
	should return a failure exit code. Note, this is non-standard, but
	seems to be supported in both intel and gfortran.

	* src/convolution.f90:
	replaced several "stop" instructions with calls to wae_error(...)

2023-02-01  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> (with Alexander Karlberg)

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90:
	started to add support for table interpolation to use a
	non-standard iflv_max

2023-01-29  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/welcome_message.f90:
	updated date in welcome message

2022-07-20  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/dglap_holders.f90 (InitDglapHolder): 
	* src/dglap_objects.f90 (InitSplitMatTimeNLO): 
	* src/splitting_functions.f90:
	added ingredients needed for FFN time-like evolution at NLO. Tests
	ongoing. 

2021-09-22 Wed  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/convolution.f90:
	arrange in-range tests for y-in-range to make sure that if y is nan
	then the test fails.

2021-07-25  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/convolution.f90:
	added DisableGridLocking() and RestoreGridLocking()
	for user programs to be able to more safely handle
	grid locking suspension.

	Implemented minor fix to grid_conv initialisation with negative
	orders, whereby the ny entry of the grid_conv matrix missed one
	contribution. This doesn't affect normal evolution with physical
	PDFs, because that element of the grid_conv entry multiplies the
	pdf at iy=0, which is zero in physical PDFs. But it can affect the
	use of the grid_conv entries when they are to be interpreted as
	physical quantities in their own right.

2021-05-21  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/special_functions.f90:
	* src/integrator.f90:
	replaced a set of number-terminated do loops with end do
	constructs; ran make check to verify results have not changed.

2021-05-12  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/CMakeLists.txt:
	added this from Gregory Soyez to facilitate
	use with other projects

2020-08-29 Gavin Salam<gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90:
	replaced intent(out) with intent(inout) so that
	automatic deletion works

2020-08-27 Gavin Salam<gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90
	This should now detect if a table had previously been allocated
	and delete it accordingly.

2020-07-08  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/pdf_representation.f90:
	removed "pure" from pdfr_HumanToEvln_sc, because it wasn't being
	relied on and caused issues with the -fno-automatic option
	that is used in POWHEG.

2020-04-14  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* benchmarking/benchmark.f90:
	changed sub_defs_io "use" to avoid conflicts with 
	Value(...) from hoppet (as reported by Federico Buccioni)


2018-12-27  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_evolution.f90:
	this now handles evolution below the QCD scale, using a zero QCD
	coupling to signal to the evolution.f90 routine that it should not
	do any QCD evolution there.

	* src/evolution.f90:
	some small changes to aid communibation with the QED evolution
	code, including skipping certain bits of code when alphas = 0, and
	changing ev_force_old_dt to be a variable (rather than a
	parameter), so that one can play with it.

	* src/qed_coupling.f90 (qed_coupling_module):
	switched the scale for the turn-on of 3 light flavours
	to be 1 GeV, to avoid issues with QCD couplings that aren't
	defined below that scale. 

	* src/qcd_coupling.f90: 
	* src/new_as.f90:
	added support for nloop = 0, i.e. fixed coupling. It sets up all
	the usual infrastructure (flavour thresholds, etc.), but then when
	you ask for the coupling, it just returns the fixed value that it
	was initialised with.

	* tests/coupling-fixed.f90: *** ADDED ***
	for running a quick test that the new fixed-coupling functionality
	works.


2017-10-31  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	switched to 1.2.1-devel

2017-10-30  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* NEWS:
	finalised NEWS file for 1.2.0 release

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	changed version to 1.2.0

	* src/new_as.f90 (na_Init): 
	fixed bug that arises when nloop is not specified (use of optional
	nloop argument instead of nah%nloop)

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex: 
	* tarit.sh:
	added pdf files to tarball and added a whole bunch of pdf files +
	changed documentation so that it works with both pdflatex and
	latex.
	Also changed front page to reflect contributions from Frederic and
	Alexander. 

	* tests/README-hoppet-tests.org:
	added some old test output (from April 22)

2017-02-02  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/evolution.f90 (ev_CrossMassThreshold):
	bug fix to address issue reported by Florian Lyonnet of error of

	   FATAL ERROR in cobj_ConvMTM:
           Mass threshold matrix is undefined

	when using 2-loop cached evolution. It was caused by
	evop%cross_mass_threshold not being properly initialised to
	.false. in that situation. Also removed some redundant code
	lines.

2016-07-06  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_objects.f90 (qed_objects):
	added routine (Copy) for copying qed_split_mat objects (and
	sub-object)

	* src/sort.f90 (sort):
	added sort_array() routine which acts as if an in-place sort is
	carried out (relying on idx); made it public (and also swap)

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90 (FillPdfTable_LHAPDF):
	fixed serious issue for tabulations where nf info is associated,
	where Q was being recalculated wrongly for each iQ rather than
	read in from the table%Q_vals array.

2016-06-26  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/couplings.f90:         *** ADDED ***
	* src/qcd_qed_coupling.f90:  *** ADDED ***
	* src/qed_coupling.f90:
	* tests/test_qed.f90
	copied couplings.f90 over from hopper (aborted OO v2 of
	hoppet). It has the small adaptation that any segment should
	always have at least n_interp+1 nodes.

	Then used it to build the QCDQEDCoupling type in
	qcd_qed_coupling. Interface may yet evolve.

	Small mods also to qed_coupling.f90 to make useful pieces public.

	Conclusion from tests/test_qed.f90 is that effect of mixed QCD/QED
	effects in the running coupling are ~0.2% on the QED coupling,
	which, given that we don't have a proper treatment of hadronic
	thresholds, is irrelevant.

2016-06-23  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/pdf_general.f90:
	started introducing support for PDFs with non-standard number of
	flavours. WORK HERE IS INCOMPLETE

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90
	added support for non-standard number of flavours and for a
	tabulation that uses QED evolution. Currently untested.

	* example_f77/compare_lhapdf_hoppet.f:
	changed the default pdf


2016-06-07  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_objects.f90 (qed_objects):
	tried to get rid of Fortran-2003 constructs

2016-06-07  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@lxplus0031.cern.ch>

	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	this now handles gfortran compiler names such as gfortran-61, etc.

2016-05-27  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_objects.f90 (AllocPDFWithLeptons):
	fixed wrong upper bound for flavour dimension

	* src/qed_coupling.f90 (qed_coupling_module):
	added an option to pass value_at_scale_0 when initialising
	the coupling (e.g. to test sensitivity to higher orders, etc.)

	Also changed the "light quarks" mass to 0.5GeV.

	* src/qed_evolution.f90 (QEDQCDEvolvePDF):
	fixed a bug with the initial nf values

2016-05-26  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	updated date!

	* src/qed_coupling.f90:
	added info on n_thresholds inside the qed_coupling type and
	extended the bounds of some of the arrays to make it easier to
	access threshold information without worrying about out-of-bounds
	accesses. 

	* src/qed_evolution.f90:  *** ADDED ***
	added this routine for QED evolution, including thresholds;
	comprehensive testing still remains to be performed.

	For now alphas and alpha_QED still have separate evolutions
	(whereas with O(alpha alpha_s) splitting kernels they should have
	coupled evolution).

	* src/evolution.f90:
	factored out some part of the machinery into a new module,
	evolution_helper, so that it can be used by the QED
	evolution. Nothing should change in the public interface.

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	added a "-g" option to gfortran by default, to aid with debugging

	* src/qed_objects.f90: *** ADDED ***
	started work on a module for holding QED splitting matrices,
	performing the flavour convolutions, etc. Currently the LO
	QED splitting matrix appears to be working. The NLO is also mostly
	tested. 

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90 (hoppetStartExtended):
	this now uses InitGridDefDefault for creating its grid

	* src/convolution.f90:
	added InitGridDefDefault(grid, dy, ymax, order) to make it
	a bit easier to create good grids

	added 2d version of TruncatedMoment

2016-05-15  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* tests/test_qed.f90:
	added tests of moments of the QED splitting functions.

	* src/splitting_functions.f90:
	made sf_S2(x) public, for us in the qed_splitting_functions

	* src/qed_splitting_functions.f90: *** ADDED ***
	added the QED splitting functions from 1512.00612

2016-05-10  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_coupling.f90:
	put in correct values for lepton masses and fine structure
	constant + removed diagnostic printouts.

2016-04-24  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* tests/test_qed.f90: *** ADDED ***
	file for first tests of QED coupling

	* src/qed_coupling.f90: *** ADDED ***
	got a first basic version of a 1-loop QED coupling -- interface
	may evolve

2016-04-04  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex:
	added mention of running up to 4 loops

	* src/new_as.f90 (na_Init):
	added protection against 4-loop running with non-standard colour factors.

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	added Frederic and Alexander as contributors.

	* src/qcd.f90
	* src/new_as.f90
	* src/types.f90

	Put in changes from Alexander Karlberg to support 4-loop running
	of the coupling, including flavour thresholds. Alexander has
	tested this against my python code (itself tested against
	rundec). Note -- there's support only for QCD colour factors, not
	general colour factors.

2015-06-26  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	added some code to delete old tabulations and dglap holder if
	hoppetStart is called more than once.

2015-04-22  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* NEWS:
	started work on comments for 1.2.0 release

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex:
	added note on multi-splitting function support in
	hoppetEvalSplit. 

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	upped version number to 1.2.0-devel (will now try to follow
	semantic version 2.0.0 numbering for releases, http://semver.org/,
	so that patch number changes are mainly for bug fixes).

	* tests/README-hoppet-tests.org: *** ADDED ***
	added this file in order to keep track of future tests

	* tests/streamlined_multisplit.f90: *** ADDED ***
	added this routine for testing the nested splitting-function
	convolutions.

	* src/dummy_pdfs.f90: *** ADDED ***
	added this module with dummy unpolarized PDFs (given how often
	they are needed); interface of internal functions may still evolve

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	removed commented bits of code and improved comments in some
	places now that tests have been run for hoppetEvalSplit.

2015-04-21  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	work in progress on getting support for composite iloop values
	(e.g. 11, 12, 21, 111) in hoppetEvalSplit.

2015-04-07  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90 (EvalPdfTable_yQ):
	removed redundant if statement for case where we are out of Q
	bounds (correct handling was already taking place elsewhere).

2015-03-24  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	removed perl warning message about unnecessary "defined" in a
	couple of places; 

2013-04-18  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* example_f77/Makefile (LHAPDFLIBS): 
	  now set using lhapdf-config (assuming it's in your path).

	* example_f77/compare_lhapdf_hoppet.f:
	  now explicitly takes alphas(MZ) from LHAPDF (and set dlnlnQ
	  automatically based on dy).

2012-12-24  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90: 
	  added a note that tables(0) should become a "preserved" part of
	  the hoppet interface, for people who want the convenience of the
	  streamlined interface, but also a little more power.

2012-08-03  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  switched version over to 1.1.6-devel (but everything is for now
	  still identical to 1.1.5)

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  added publication reference to welcome message.

2012-08-03  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* NEWS
	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  updated for release of version 1.1.5
	  (HoppetWelcomeMessage): 

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex:
	  documented PartonLuminosity(...) function.

2012-07-30  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>


	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  --install-modules, if present, indicates that modules should be
	  installed by default; --mod-prefix=... indicates a non-standard location

	* configure:
	  added support for --mod-prefix, and arranged for default
	  mod-prefix to be PREFIX/include/hoppet + made use of the new
	  --install-modules option of scripts/makef95makefile

	* INSTALL:
	  adapted the documentation to reflect the new module installation scheme

	* hoppet-config.in:
	  --fflags now handles the configurable modules location;
	  --ldflags can now be used as a synonym for --libs


2012-07-27  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* hoppet-config.in: 
	  added error handling in case of unrecognized arguments;
	  added an --fflags argument for flags to be used with fortran
	  compilers.

	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  changed behaviour of install, so that it now also installs the
	  .mod files (needed for programs like JetVHeto),
	  without having to explicitly perform a "make install-mod".

	  Also ensured that .h and .mod files are installed with -rw-r--r--
	  permissions (rather than executable, as before).

2012-05-17  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* README: 
	  added a note about ranlib "no symbol" warnings. Thanks to Merjin
	  van de Klundert for suggesting this.

2012-05-13  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* README:
	  a few small edits to update things re compilation

	* tarit.sh: 
	  ChangeLog had been left out of the tarball; so now include it.

2012-05-11  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90 (get_lnlnQ_wgts): 
	  fixed bug that when Q was too small lnln came out as NaN, as did
	  the PDF (while it should have been frozen or zero). The lnln
	  function now returns a large negative number instead.

	* src/dglap_objects.f90: 
	  changed error message in case of mismatch of flavours between
	  PDF and splitting function so that both nf values get printed.

2012-04-17  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* src/qcd_coupling.f90 (qcd_coupling): 
	  added RunningCoupling(...) interface as an alternative to the
	  Value(...) function, whose name was rather meaningless when
	  using the globally initialised coupling.

2012-02-14  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/convolution.f90: 
	  added a function PartonLuminosity(grid, gq1, gq2) to efficiently
	  evaluate the partonic luminosity that comes from the "collision"
	  of two grid quantities. Its accuracy currently relies on PDFs
	  vanishing smoothly near y=0. While this routine functions
	  adequately, the exact interface and internal implementation
	  could change in the future.

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  updated copyright date


2012-01-20  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	  arranged for gfortran to be the default compiler for all
	  architectures (previously was only for linux)

	* scripts/check:
	  fixed bug related to make check on mac (in if condition),
	  following bug report by Aneesh Manohar and Juan Rojo.

2011-11-23  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage): 
	  updated version number to 1.1.4

	* src/new_as.f90: 
	* src/qcd_coupling.f90: 
	  fixed a couple of issues with double-declared return-value
	  variables. (Pointed out by Alberto Guffanti)

2011-03-09  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* example_f77/variants/tabulation_example_exact_nnlo.f: ***ADDED***
          variant that illustrates how to set the exact nnlo splitting
	  functions rather than parametrised ones.

2011-03-09  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* example_f77/tabulation_example.f:
	  corrected wrong initial PDF function in the cached part of the
	  tabulation example.

2011-02-22  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex: 
	  documented streamlined interface to Pole v. MSbar mass choice.

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:

	  functions (a little dirty?)

	* src/dglap_objects.f90: 
	  extended mass_threshold_mat so that it has all the info needed
	  for PDF mass thresholds not just for pole-quark masses but also
	  MSbar masses.

	  which gives indications of library names, etc.
	
	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  now outputs a .makef95.prefix file indicating what the prefix was

	* Makefile (install):

    	  Following discussions with Wei-Tian Deng, introduced
	  factscheme_FragMSbar, and added support for it at 1-loop; tested
	  the momentum sum-rule and it is consistent.

	* switched warnings_and_errors over to a new version.
	
	* changed interfaces in evolution.f90 and pdf_tabulate.f90 so as
	to make nloop an optional argument, with the default number of
	loops being deduced from the running_coupling object; also
	introduced NumberOfLoops(coupling) function for the
	running_coupling, allowing other routines to find out what is
	going on.

  	* changed directory structure (for now), with a new directory
	tests/, while the old testing directory has become testing-other
	(devoted to testing things that are not directly related the
	program development).

	almost bound to be some residual heavy-quark piece).

	* one internal name change in convolution.f90 to avoid subsequent
	problems with SetToCommutator.
	
	* merged dglap_objects and dglap_objects hidden (which were
	separated only for support of legacy f90 compilers, hopefully no
	longer in existence). Added SetToZero, SetToConvolution,
	SetToCommutator. 
	
	* removed number of loops from the split_mat type (it wasn't being
	used).

	* Put some case-insensitivity into the convert.pl script.
	
        * Added version of CopyHumanPdfToEvln etc. where first argument
	is nf (integer) rather than a pdf_rep -- that should makes its use
	a bit more transparent to people. Also switched the rest of the
	code to make use of the new call and removed all prep information
	from sigma_holder. [Tested that answers are unchanged!]
	
	* further name changes throughout

	* added Delete function for sigma_holder
	
        * convolution.f90: fixed various potential memory leaks automatic
	detection of need to allocate grid_conv objects.
	
	* pdf_representation.f90: representation changes now leave decoupled
	heavy flavours unchanged, rather than setting them to zero.

	* various name changes to simplify life for the user (mainly
	removal of prefixes which add little information and just make for
	more things to remember)

	* added scripts/convert.pl which carries out most of the name
	changes automatically (sometimes one or two resulting name clashes
	then had to be fixed by hand). Hopefully this script can also be
	used for conversion of existing example programs
	
	* documentation moving forwards. Section 3 on one-flavour problems
	is now at the first draft stage. Should probably next move on to
	section 4 for dealing with flavour problems.

	* switched sort.f90 to be my own version.
  	* removed unused interpolation routines from interpolation.f90

	* Added the example_f90/small_fast_tab.f90 program to examine
	timings and accuracies for a (by default) small tabulation.

	Default parameters give 10^{-4} accuracy at 3 ms/evolution over
	the small region (Rojo's request: 9-e3<x<0.75, Q<50). Timings
	increase to about 8.5ms/evolution for a larger range (1e-6<x,
	Q<14000) and I haven't checked accuracies (NB 6ms with better
	ifort optimization). Note also that eps dependence in integrations
	still needs to be checked.

        Timings below are for small table, with default parameters (see
	svn of this date!), on tycho and gaia (3.4GHz P4).
	
	                          init (s)   evln (ms)     x,Q point (mu s)
	ifort -O                     2.2       3.0               2.8
	ifort -O3 -axP               2.1       2.1               2.6
        lf95 -O                      2.7       2.2               2.2 
        gfortran -O3 -march=i686     5.9     130               180  
	g95 -O3 -march=i686          7.8      21                22            
	
	* increased default interpolation order in the pdf_tabulation to 3
	(2 was definitely too low and 4 might be better). Found that a
	slightly small spacing than used in the f77 routine could be
	beneficial (e.g. 0.07). NB: haven't checked correctness of results
	with -axP on intel (there are reports [banfi] of sporadic
	non-understood problems).
	

2006-04-06  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	Version 1.0
	
	* imported sources from the PDFevln package, with the addition of
	some f77 hooks and the removal of all the main programs; also a
	directory structure has been introduced so that the library source
	in is src/ while the example and testing programs are in separate
	directories.
