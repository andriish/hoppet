QED merging notes (2023-09)
===========================

- [ ] understand 'CHECK 111 case' warning in qcd_qed_coupling.f90
- [x] see if any changes were made in lepton structure function work
      NB: addition of with_Plp_nnloqed in qed_evolution, included 
      but is the interface right?
- [ ] create benchmark / "make check" files?
      (start from tests/test_qed_lepton_evol.f90? See gen_qed_grid.f90 in photon project)
- [ ] create some kind of streamlined interface?      
- [ ] document 
  * [ ] InitQEDSplitMat (and its structure)
  * [ ] AllocPDFWithLeptons
  * [ ] QEDQCDEvolvePDF
  * [ ] EvolvePdfTableQED (+ how to create the correctly-sized table in the first place)
  * [ ] NB: what do we do with QCDQEDCoupling, which is not currently used?

Old notes
=========

- more explicit error message when coupling is used (un?)initialised
  [and clean up of whole alphas code?]

- get intrinsic charm working with cached evolution (threshold
  operators should become additive rather than multiplicative)

- for version 2: replace evop%cross_mass_threshold with evop%apply_mass_threshold
