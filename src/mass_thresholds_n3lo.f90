!  J. Ablinger, et. al.,   arXiv:1406.4654  -- A3NSqq_H, all moments & x-space (App.B, even/odd to be understood). From Arnd: Even = unpol, odd = pol.

!  J. Ablinger, et. al.,   arXiv:2211.05462 -- A3Sgg_H, x-space in eqs. 4.6 (Î´), 4.7 (+) and ancilliary file with full result 
!  J. Ablinger, et. al.,   arXiv:2311.00644 -- A3PShg, x-space in ancilliary file with full result, but only "first-order factorisable contributions". Need to look closer to understand if these are leading or not. From Arnd: Don't use these for pheno, use param from

!  The below table tries to summarise our understanding
!  exct  = all moments known and x-space derived as exact inverse Mellin transform
!  appr = Not all moments known
!  parm  = parametrised results

! Pieces that are going to be needed for my purposes are those from that
! code which are free of logs of mu^2/m^2, since we will for the time being
! keep these two scales equal (and later on, if we do not then pieces
! with logs will be reconstructed appropriately?)
!
! Thus the pieces needed, in the notation of the second of the above 
! papers, are:
!
! For Delta (f_k + f_kbar):
!   A^{3,NS}_{qq,H}    A3NSqq_H <-- Can probably be extracted from 1406 without too much trouble
!   A^{3,PS}_{qq,H}    A3PSqq_H <-- Extracted from 1403.
!   A^{3,S}_{qg,H}     A3Sqg_H  <-- Extracted from 1403. 
!
! For Delta (f_H + f_Hbar)
!   A^{3,S}_{Hg}       A3PShg   
!   A^{3,PS}_{Hq}      A3PShq   <-- Can extract from MSHT
!
! For Delta (G)
!   A^{3,S}_{gq,H}     A3Sgq_H  <-- Can extract from MSHT
!   A^{3,S}_{gg,H}     A3Sgg_H
