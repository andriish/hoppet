QED merging notes (2023-09)
===========================

- [ ] understand 'CHECK 111 case' warning in qcd_qed_coupling.f90
- [ ] see if any changes were made in lepton structure function work



Old notes
=========

- more explicit error message when coupling is used (un?)initialised
  [and clean up of whole alphas code?]

- get intrinsic charm working with cached evolution (threshold
  operators should become additive rather than multiplicative)

- for version 2: replace evop%cross_mass_threshold with evop%apply_mass_threshold
