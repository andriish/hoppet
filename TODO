Generic TODO
============
- [ ] change mZ from 91.2 to 91.1876Â±0.0021? (Any impact on results checks? Not used?)
- [x] similarly, check EM coupling at 0 and mZ
- [ ] fix welcome message, version numbers and author list (in manual and welcome)
- [ ] run ordercite (or use equivalent latex package)

QED merging notes (2023-09)
===========================

- [ ] understand 'CHECK 111 case' warning in qcd_qed_coupling.f90
- [x] see if any changes were made in lepton structure function work
      NB: addition of with_Plp_nnloqed in qed_evolution, included 
      but is the interface right?

- [x] create benchmark / "make check" files?
      (start from tests/test_qed_lepton_evol.f90? See gen_qed_grid.f90 in photon project)

- [ ] Interface improvements
  * [ ] create some kind of streamlined interface?      
  * [x] introduce AllocPdfTableWithLeptons?
- [ ] documentation
  * [x] InitQEDSplitMat (and its structure)
  * [x] AllocPDFWithLeptons
  * [x] QEDQCDEvolvePDF
  * [x] EvolvePdfTableQED (+ how to create the correctly-sized table in the first place)
  * [ ] NB: what do we do with QCDQEDCoupling, which is not currently used?
  * [x] mention that cached evolution not yet available

- [x] question of global option versus arguments to functions
  * with_Plq_nnloqed, nqcdloop_qed

- Streamlined interface
  * [ ] resolve any QED-TBD comments
  * [ ] make sure table-index handling is back in
  * [x] introduce hoppetSetQED()
  * [x] decide muR_Q with QED -> do not support it
  * [ ] one day, allow for tables with QED convolutions
    * 1-5 = QCD
    * 6 = alpha
    * 7 = alpha * alphas
    * 8 = alpha^2
    * 9 = alpha * alphas^2
- merge from master

Boolean problem when interfacing c++ to fortran
==============================================
Passing booleans by reference between c++ and fortran
does not work; we passed them as integers.

2023-09 Structure function branch merging notes
===============================================
- [x] add conditional compilation of hplog5 and exact coefficient functions
- [ ] add mention of coefficient function to welcome_message

Old notes
=========

- more explicit error message when coupling is used (un?)initialised
  [and clean up of whole alphas code?]

- get intrinsic charm working with cached evolution (threshold
  operators should become additive rather than multiplicative)

- for version 2: replace evop%cross_mass_threshold with evop%apply_mass_threshold
